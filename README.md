## How To Run
The project is based on NestJs by Typescript. Also, we are using `telegraf` library to handle the bot functionality. 
Follow the commands to run the project:

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn start:dev
```
**Note**: There is a folder called `sample-data` in the roof the project. We created a sample json files from real data to speed up the developing.
